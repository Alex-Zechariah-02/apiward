// and every comma-separated element, ignoring empty ones. Trimming white space
// here covers at least what the proxy trims, so no name the proxy removes is
// missed. An element that is not a field name, such as a quoted one, comes
// back unchanged and matches no field, as it removes none at the proxy.
