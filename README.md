# Lightweight Security Policy Gateway for REST APIs

This Go gateway enforces a shared, configurable security policy before requests reach REST APIs. It runs its own HTTP server and reverse proxy using the Go standard library.

## Security controls

The gateway has five security controls:

- **JWT authentication** checks RS256 access tokens with a trusted issuer, audience, expiry, subject and named signing key.
- **Role-based access control** allows or blocks each call by the role of the caller.
- **Rate limiting** counts requests per account or direct client address for each operation over a sliding time window. Public operations use the client address. A request above the limit gets the answer 429 and goes no further.
- **Request validation** checks the JSON body and selected headers against the operation's bounded JSON Schema. Bodies can include arrays with item schemas and item-count limits. Ambiguous fields and malformed Unicode are rejected.
- **Security event logging** records each security decision in a local file. A request goes to an API only after its record is safely on disk. If the log cannot be written, the gateway stops letting requests through.

Each request uses one policy version from start to end. When one control rejects a request, it never reaches an API. The gateway checks tokens from an outside identity provider and does not issue tokens itself. A token's `kid` selects one of the trusted public keys. Roles come from verified token claims and are kept only when the captured policy defines them. A separate blocked-account list refuses a verified account immediately and survives policy rollback. Public keys can be reloaded from operator files; an invalid reload keeps the current key set.

Policy documents use schema version 4 and contain roles and permits without per-user membership. Version 3 policies are refused rather than converted automatically. A fresh demonstration creates a version 4 policy.

An API may rewrite the path its upstream receives with `"forward": {"strip_prefix": "/api", "add_prefix": "/v2"}` (either or both): `/api/orders/7` is forwarded as `/v2/orders/7`, and `/api` as `/v2` (`/` when nothing is left). Both prefixes are fixed paths without a trailing `/`, `*`, `%`, `.` or `..` segment, and the strip prefix must lead every target of the API at a segment boundary; otherwise the policy is refused `REWRITE_INVALID`. Routing, access, sign-in, roles, rate limits, validation and the security log all use the path the client sent; the rewrite is applied only when the request is forwarded. The rewritten path is checked again, and a request whose rewritten path is not canonical is refused `400 path_not_canonical`. The security log records `forwarded_path` beside `path` when the two differ.

An operation may carry host and header conditions with `"when": {"hosts": ["api.example.com", "*.example.com"], "headers": [{"name": "X-Version", "value": "2"}]}`: 1 to 16 lower-case host names (exact, or `*.` followed by a domain, which matches any name ending in that domain, never the domain itself) and 1 to 8 headers with exact values; every condition must hold. The request's `Host` is compared without its port and case. A header holds only when the request carries it exactly once with that value, and only names a header schema could declare are allowed. Several operations may share a target and method: the one with the most conditions that hold is selected, else the one without conditions; when none applies the request is answered `404`. Conditions only select an operation, whose own access, sign-in, roles, rate and body rules decide. The compiler refuses two conditioned operations of equal rank that one request could meet (`TARGET_COLLISION`) and a conditioned operation weaker than the unconditioned one beside it (`CONDITION_WEAKER`): allowed where that one is denied, public where it requires sign-in, a role it does not permit, a missing, differently keyed or looser rate rule, a body it refuses or a larger or different one, or a missing header schema. The access checker takes optional `host` and `headers` (an object of names and values) to check such a request; the change preview reports requests to conditioned operations as unknown, since the log keeps neither.

An API may let web pages on other sites call it from a browser with `"cors": {"origins": ["https://shop.example.com"], "methods": ["GET", "POST"], "headers": ["Content-Type"], "expose": ["X-Total"], "credentials": false, "max_age_seconds": 600}`: 1 to 32 exact lower-case origins (`scheme://host[:port]`, no path, no default port) or exactly `["*"]`, which is allowed only without credentials on an API whose operations are all public (otherwise `CORS_WILDCARD_NOT_ALLOWED`); methods of the API's own operations; up to 32 request headers and 16 exposed headers; a preflight cache time of 0 to 86400 seconds (600 by default). The gateway answers a preflight (`OPTIONS` with `Origin` and `Access-Control-Request-Method`) on such an API itself and never forwards it: `204` with the CORS headers when the origin, the method and every requested header are allowed, `204` without them otherwise. Preflights are recorded as `request.preflight` events (decision `allowed` or `refused`, code `cors_preflight` or `cors_refused`) and, when one of the API's public operations has a rate rule, limited per client address by the first such rule on a counter of their own. Every answer for the API, refusals included, carries `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Vary: Origin` for an allowed origin; CORS headers from the upstream are replaced. Browser access never admits a request: every other check applies unchanged.

An API's `"response_headers": {"hsts": true, "nosniff": true, "frame": "deny", "referrer": "no-referrer", "remove": ["Server"]}` adds `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000` (only on requests received over TLS), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options` (`deny` or `sameorigin`) and `Referrer-Policy` (`no-referrer` or `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`) when the upstream did not set them, and removes up to 16 named upstream headers (never the gateway's own headers, `Access-Control-*` or the response framing). Gateway refusals always carry `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.

An API's `"allow_addresses": ["10.0.0.0/8", "2001:db8::/32"]` (1 to 256 ranges in canonical CIDR form) admits only those client addresses: others are refused `403 address_not_allowed` before any other check of the operation. A separate blocked address list in the gateway's database refuses a client address at once, before the policy is consulted, with `403 address_blocked`, and survives policy rollback. The Admin API manages it like the blocked accounts: `GET /admin/blocked-addresses`, `PUT /admin/blocked-addresses/{range}` (`{"reason", "expires_at"?}`, an expiry 1 minute to 30 days ahead) and `DELETE /admin/blocked-addresses/{range}`, with `{range}` a URL-encoded canonical CIDR (a single address is `/32` or `/128`; an IPv4-mapped range is stored as IPv4), at most 1,024 entries, recorded in the history as `address.block` and `address.unblock`. The client address is the direct peer of the connection.

## Safe policy changes

A policy can pass all checks and still cause problems when it is in use. Administrators can change the shared policy through two workflows:

- **Confirmed Policy Activation.** A new permanent policy starts as provisional and is enforced at once, with a confirmation deadline of 1 second to 24 hours. An administrator confirms it or rolls it back. If nobody confirms it in time, the gateway goes back to the previous policy by itself, also when it was stopped over the deadline. A provisional policy never admits a request after its deadline, even if the rollback runs late. Only one provisional policy can exist at a time, and each one ends exactly once.
- **Temporary Policy Override.** An administrator can give a role one more operation or take one away, raise or lower an operation's rate limit, or block an operation, for 1 second to 24 hours. The change is applied on top of the permanent policy without changing it, and it ends by itself at its expiry time or when it is revoked. It cannot skip token checks or request checks, reduce logging, open a blocked operation or change where requests go. Two overrides cannot change the same thing, and a new permanent policy that would clash with an override is refused. While a provisional policy waits for confirmation, no new override can be made. Rate counts carry over, so an override never gives a fresh quota. A restored backup never brings an old override back.

## Import an OpenAPI description

`gateway policy import-openapi` turns an OpenAPI 3.0 or 3.1 description (JSON, or YAML 1.2) into a new policy file for review. It runs offline: it reads only the files it is given, never fetches a `$ref`, and never activates anything. Stage the result as a draft, trial it and confirm it like any other change.

```
gateway policy import-openapi --spec <file.json|.yaml|.yml> --api <id> --upstream <id>
  --base <policy.json> [--max-body-bytes <n>] [--with-permits] --out <new file> --report <new file>
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--spec` | The description, at most 1 MiB; the extension chooses JSON or YAML |
| `--api` | The API to create, or to replace with its operations and the permits that name them |
| `--upstream` | An upstream already in `--base` that serves the API |
| `--base` | The policy to build on, for example the output of `demo policy export` |
| `--max-body-bytes` | Body limit for imported request bodies without `x-apiward-max-bytes`: 1 to 1,048,576, default 16,384 |
| `--with-permits` | Read `x-apiward-roles` into permits, adding missing roles; without it no permit is created |
| `--out`, `--report` | New files; the command never overwrites a file and writes both or neither |

Exit status: `0` every operation mapped; `2` both files written, but some operations were refused or widened (read the report); `1` nothing written (bad flags, unreadable or refused description, an output file exists, or the result does not compile).

**How it maps.** Each path and method becomes one operation `<api>.<operationId>`, allowed, with sign-in required unless the description says `security: []`. No permits are created unless `--with-permits` reads `x-apiward-roles`; grant roles afterwards. A path whose last segment is a parameter (`/orders/{id}`) becomes the prefix `/orders/*`, which also matches deeper paths. Header parameters become the header schema; query, path and cookie parameters are listed as not enforced. A JSON request body becomes a body rule. Schema `$ref`s inside the file are inlined, descriptive keywords (`description`, `example`, `x-…`) are removed, and an object without `additionalProperties` allows extra fields, as OpenAPI does. Every operation is checked by the gateway's own compiler, and the whole result is compiled before anything is written.

**What is refused.** An operation is left out, with a code in the report, when it cannot be expressed exactly: `TRACE` (`METHOD_REFUSED`); a missing or invalid `operationId` (`OPERATION_ID_INVALID`, with a suggestion) or one used twice (`OPERATION_ID_DUPLICATE`); a parameter in the middle of a path (`PATH_TEMPLATE_UNSUPPORTED`); two operations on the same method and target (`TARGET_COLLISION`); API keys, Basic, mutual TLS or optional sign-in (`SECURITY_SCHEME_UNSUPPORTED`); non-JSON bodies (`MEDIA_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED`); a schema keyword the gateway cannot enforce, such as `format`, `pattern` or `oneOf` (`SCHEMA_KEYWORD_UNSUPPORTED`; dropping it would accept more than described); a `$ref` to another file (`EXTERNAL_REF`), a missing one (`REF_INVALID`) or a circular one (`SCHEMA_CYCLE`); a schema deeper than 16 levels or larger than 4,096 values once inlined (`SCHEMA_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`); and anything else the compiler rejects (`COMPILER_REFUSED`, with its code and field). YAML anchors, aliases, merge keys, tags, several documents in one file, duplicate or non-string keys and `.nan`/`.inf` refuse the whole file, naming the line.

**Report.** JSON; every list is always present:

```json
{"spec_version": "3.1.0", "source_format": "yaml", "api": "orders", "operations_in_spec": 8,
 "mapped": [{"method": "GET", "path": "/orders", "operation": "orders.listOrders", "target": "/orders", "auth": "required"}],
 "widened": [{"method": "GET", "path": "/orders/{id}", "operation": "orders.getOrder", "target": "/orders/*", "auth": "required", "note": "matches /orders/<anything>, including deeper paths"}],
 "assumed": [{"operation": "orders.createOrder", "field": "body.max_bytes", "value": 16384}],
 "changed": [{"operation": "orders.updateOrder", "field": "body", "note": "The description allows no body; the gateway refuses a request without one (415 without a JSON Content-Type, else 400 malformed_json)."}],
 "refused": [{"method": "GET", "path": "/orders/{id}/items", "code": "PATH_TEMPLATE_UNSUPPORTED", "message": "A templated segment followed by more segments cannot be expressed."}],
 "needs_permissions": ["orders.listOrders", "orders.getOrder"],
 "scopes_not_mapped": ["orders:read"],
 "not_enforced": [{"operation": "orders.listOrders", "parameter": "page", "in": "query"}],
 "annotations_removed": [{"operation": "orders.createOrder", "field": "#/components/schemas/NewOrder/description"}],
 "removed_operations": ["orders.old"],
 "removed_permits": [{"role": "customer", "operation": "orders.old"}],
 "ignored": ["responses", "servers", "tags"]}
```

`mapped` and `widened` list the imported operations (`note` explains a default they rely on); `assumed` lists values the import chose; `changed` lists behaviour the gateway enforces differently from the description; `refused` entries may add `field` (a JSON Pointer into the description, or the compiler's field) and `suggestion`; `needs_permissions` lists the signed-in operations no role can call yet; `removed_operations` and `removed_permits` are what replacing `--api` took out of the base; `ignored` names description members with no effect on the policy (`servers`, `responses`, `callbacks`, `webhooks`, `links`, `tags`).

**Gateway extensions.** An operation may carry the members the export writes; each is checked, and any other `x-apiward-…` member refuses the operation (`EXTENSION_INVALID`):

| Member | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `x-apiward-target` | the prefix target the path stands for, such as `/orders/*` for `/orders/{rest}` | the operation is mapped, not widened: the description states that deeper paths match |
| `x-apiward-access` | `allow` or `deny` | the operation's access; absent means `allow` |
| `x-apiward-rate` | `{"algorithm": "sliding-window", "count", "window_seconds", "key"}` | the operation's rate rule, as in a policy |
| `x-apiward-max-bytes` | 1 to 1,048,576 | the body limit; needs a request body |
| `x-apiward-roles` | list of role identifiers | the roles permitted, read only with `--with-permits` |
| `x-apiward-when` | `{"hosts", "headers"}`, as in a policy | the operation's host and header conditions |

At the root, `x-apiward-forward`, `x-apiward-cors`, `x-apiward-response-headers` and `x-apiward-addresses` become the imported API's `forward`, `cors`, `response_headers` and `allow_addresses`, each with exactly the members of the policy's; any other member, or a value of another shape, refuses the description.

## Export a policy as OpenAPI

`gateway policy export-openapi` writes one API of a policy as an OpenAPI 3.1 description (JSON, or YAML by the `--out` extension), for review or for tools that read OpenAPI. Importing that file onto the same policy with `--with-permits` gives the same policy back.

```
gateway policy export-openapi --policy <policy.json> --api <id>
  --out <new file.json|.yaml|.yml> --report <new file> [--with-upstream]
```

Each operation becomes the path and method of its target, with `operationId` = the operation identifier without the `<api>.` prefix. A prefix target `/orders/*` becomes `/orders/{rest}` with `x-apiward-target: /orders/*`. Sign-in required becomes the bearer scheme `apiward`; public becomes `security: []`. A body rule becomes a required `application/json` request body with its schema and `x-apiward-max-bytes`; a header schema becomes header parameters (its root `additionalProperties` is not written, since the gateway checks declared headers only). Access, rate rule and permitted roles go into `x-apiward-access`, `x-apiward-rate` and `x-apiward-roles`; the API's forward rule, browser access, response headers and address allow list go into the root members `x-apiward-forward`, `x-apiward-cors`, `x-apiward-response-headers` and `x-apiward-addresses`, and an operation's conditions into `x-apiward-when`. A description holds one operation per path and method, so a second operation on the same target and method (a conditioned one, after the one without conditions) is not exported and is reported `changed`. The upstream address is written as a server only with `--with-upstream`.

Exit status: `0` the description means exactly what the policy does; `2` both files written, but something differs (read `changed`): a prefix target, which OpenAPI reads as one segment while the gateway also matches deeper paths; an identifier without the `<api>.` prefix, which comes back with it; a target containing `{` or `}`, which is not exported; `1` nothing written. The report lists `exported` (`operation`, `method`, `path`), `changed` (`operation`, `field`, `note`) and `omitted` (what a flag would add).

## Migrate from another gateway

Migration runs in two offline steps with a file to review between them. `gateway migrate import` reads a configuration and writes an **exchange file**: the configuration as an OpenAPI 3.1 description with the gateway extensions above, plus a ledger that classifies every setting it found. `gateway migrate policy` turns an exchange file into a new policy file. Neither command activates anything: read the reports, then stage, trial and confirm the policy like any other change. The supported source formats are `openapi` and `kong-deck` (below).

```
gateway migrate import --from openapi|kong-deck --in <file.json|.yaml|.yml>
  --out <new exchange file.json|.yaml|.yml> --report <new file> [--decisions <overlay>]
gateway migrate policy --exchange <file> --base <policy.json> --api <id> --upstream <id>
  --out <new file> --report <new file> [--decisions <overlay>] [--with-permits]
```

Each input is read only from the named path and may be at most 8 MiB, nested at most 16 levels; YAML passes the same gate as the OpenAPI import. Outputs must not exist yet; both are created together or neither is, and the output and the report must be different files.

**The ledger** is the root member `x-apiward-migration`: `version` (`1`); `source` (`format`, `format_version`, `sha256` of the input); `items`, one per setting; `carried`, settings kept as opaque data for the gateway they came from (`vendor`, `scope`, `path`, `value`), never compiled into a policy; `credentials_skipped` (`type`, `count`), credentials counted but never read or copied; and `trust.issuers` (`issuer`, `audience`, `public_key_ids`, and `public_keys`: the PEM RSA public keys in the order of their identifiers, when the source states them; never a private key). Each item has `id` (`<format>:<kind>:<name>`), `facet` (`route`, `access`, `auth`, `roles`, `rate`, `validation`, `size`, `upstream`, `transform`, `failure` or `other`), `class`, `direction`, `source` and `target` (JSON Pointers into the input and the exchange file), `note` and `accepted`. The class is `exact`, `equivalent`, `approximated` or `not_expressible`; an approximation also states whether the gateway is `stricter`, `looser` or differs in `both` directions, and a setting that cannot be expressed has an empty `target`. Unknown members anywhere in the ledger, or an `x-apiward-…` root member other than the ledger and the API's settings (`x-apiward-forward`, `x-apiward-cors`, `x-apiward-response-headers`, `x-apiward-addresses`), refuse the file.

**Looser settings are not imported by default.** `migrate policy` leaves out each operation, and each API setting (such as `x-apiward-cors`), that a looser item points to, reporting `LOOSER_NOT_ACCEPTED` with the item's `id` in `field`. Accepting that item with a decision (below) imports it as described. Only a looser approximation can have `accepted` set to `true`.

**Decisions** are a file of repeatable choices, given with `--decisions`: an [OpenAPI Overlay 1.2.0](https://spec.openapis.org/overlay/v1.2.0.html) document (JSON or YAML, through the same gate) with `overlay: 1.2.0`, an `info` object with `title` and `version`, and a list of `actions`. `migrate import` applies them to the exchange file before writing it, so the file records them; `migrate policy` applies them to the exchange file it reads, before converting it. Actions apply in order, each to the result of the one before, and each must select exactly one node.

- Only `update` actions are accepted (each with a `target`, an `update` and an optional `description`); `remove`, `copy`, reusable actions, `components` and extension members refuse the file.
- A `target` is one of three forms: a normalized JSONPath into an operation, such as `$['paths']['/orders']['get']['x-apiward-rate']`; `$.paths[*][?@.operationId=='<id>']`; or `$['x-apiward-migration'].items[?@.id=='<id>']` (or the item's normalized path, `$['x-apiward-migration']['items'][<n>]`). Write the forms exactly, with single quotes and no spaces.
- An update merges as the Overlay specification states: objects member by member, lists by appending, single values by replacing.
- On an operation a decision may only make `x-apiward-access`, `x-apiward-rate` and `x-apiward-max-bytes` stricter: set access to `deny`; add a rate rule, or lower its `count` or lengthen its `window_seconds` with the same `algorithm` and `key`; lower the body limit (16384 bytes when none is stated). Any other change, including one that would widen access, refuses the file.
- On a ledger item the only decision is to accept a looser approximation, with exactly `{"accepted": true, "direction": "looser"}`.
- An action that selects nothing is **stale**: it changes nothing, is listed in the report's `stale_decisions` as `actions[<n>]: <target>`, and makes the exit status `2`. An action that selects more than one node, a refused action or an unreadable file writes nothing (exit `1`).

**Policy limits.** If the new policy would exceed a limit of the policy document (its size, nesting, or the number of upstreams, APIs, operations, roles or permits), nothing is written and the error starts with `POLICY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` and names the limit. Import fewer operations, or one API at a time.

Both reports extend the import report with `ledger_summary` (counts of `exact`, `equivalent`, `approximated` by `stricter`, `looser` and `both`, and `not_expressible`), `stale_decisions`, `credentials_skipped` and `carried_count`. Every list is present, possibly empty.

Exit status: `0` every setting is exact or equivalent and nothing was changed, refused, widened, carried, skipped or stale; `2` both files written, but at least one of those happened (read the report); `1` nothing written.

From an OpenAPI description, two changes of the import are items of their own, both stricter: a signed-in operation that names no roles in `x-apiward-roles` (no role is permitted, so every caller is refused until permits are added), and a body limit the description does not state (16384 bytes).

### Verifying a migration

```
gateway migrate probes --exchange <file> --out <new probes.json>
```

`probes` writes boundary probes for each operation `migrate policy` would import (those a `route` item points to, without a looser item that is not accepted), to send to the old gateway and to the new one and compare. For each operation: the request it forwards; the paths next to its target (`/a/`, `/a/x` and `/ax` for `/a`; `/a`, `/a/` and `/a/x/y` for `/a/*`; the path with an upper-case letter); each method its path does not define; for a signed-in operation a missing, malformed, expired, wrong-issuer and wrong-audience token, each permitted role and a token with no role; an invalid and an oversized body (one byte over the limit, padded with whitespace); an unmet host, a deeper wildcard host, and each header condition left out or sent in another case; with browser access, a preflight from a listed origin and with an unlisted origin, method or header; the rate limit; and the request with the upstream stopped. Probes assume the policy was made with `--with-permits` and are sent from `127.0.0.1`.

The file is `{"version": 1, "probes": [...]}`; each probe has `id` (`<operationId>:<kind>[:<variant>]`), `operation`, `method`, `path`, `headers` (`Host` included when a condition names one), `body_kind` (`none`, `valid`, `invalid`, `oversize`), `identity` (`none`, `malformed`, `expired`, `wrong_issuer`, `wrong_audience`, `role:<id>` or `no_role`) and `expect`: the `class` of the gateway's decision and the `ledger_item` that predicts a difference from the source. The classes are `forwarded` (seen at the upstream, never inferred from a status), `not_found`, `method`, `authn`, `authz` (the caller, its address or the operation refused), `rate`, `validation`, `size`, `error`, and for a preflight answered with a 2xx status `preflight_allowed` or `preflight_refused`, as a browser checks the answer (the origin, a method that is not safelisted and every requested header must be allowed). The gateway limits an API's preflights by the rate rule of its first public operation that has one; probes are not paced for it. A `rate` probe stands for a burst of the limit's count plus one, sent from the start of a second after both windows are empty; an `error` probe is sent with the upstream stopped. A difference passes only when its ledger item is an approximation in that direction: stricter when only the source forwards or allows a preflight, looser when only the gateway does. A method no route takes counts as not found where a gateway answers 404 for it, as Kong does. The command exits `0` when written and `1` otherwise.

### Migrating from and to Kong

Supported: decK files with `_format_version: "3.0"` (Kong Gateway OSS 3.9.x plugins), JSON or YAML. Other format versions, and files whose `_info.defaults` change every entity's defaults, are refused.

```
gateway migrate inventory --from kong-deck --in <kong.yaml> --report <new file>
gateway migrate import --from kong-deck --in <kong.yaml> --out <new exchange file> --report <new file> [--decisions <overlay>]
gateway migrate export --to kong-deck --exchange <file> --out <new file.json|.yaml|.yml> --report <new file>
  [--decisions <overlay>] [--with-upstream] [--with-trust] [--with-blocked]
```

`inventory` counts services, routes and their plugins, consumers, credentials by type, items per facet, and each unsupported item with its code; it writes no setting. `import` turns each route into one operation per path and method:

- A plain Kong path is a prefix: `/a` becomes `/a` and `/a/*`, which refuses `/ab` and `/a/` (stricter); `/a/` becomes `/a/*`. A route without methods takes the seven OpenAPI methods.
- Kong strips the matched path by default (`strip_path: true`) and adds the service's `path`; both become the API's forward rule (`equivalent`), as Kong's default `path_handling` (`v0`) joins them. One API has one rule: the first imported route sets it, and a route that forwards differently is refused `PATH_TRANSFORM_UNSUPPORTED`, as are stripped regular-expression paths, a route stripping different prefixes for its paths, a service path ending in `/`, and `path_handling` `v1` on a rewriting route. A route's `hosts` and `headers` become the operation's conditions (`equivalent`; Kong also prefers the route with the most of them). Hosts are lower-cased; a host with a port or a trailing wildcard, and a header with several values or a regular expression, refuse the route `ROUTE_MATCH_UNSUPPORTED`. Kong compares header values without regard to case, the gateway exactly, so a value with letters is approximated in both directions; a `*.` host takes one or more labels in both. A second route on the same path and method is refused `TARGET_COLLISION`, since the exchange file holds one operation per path and method. Regular-expression paths and the other match members (`snis`, `sources`, `destinations`, `expression`, `priority`) are refused `ROUTE_MATCH_UNSUPPORTED`, as are routes not for both `http` and `https`. On export, an operation's conditions become the route's `hosts` and `headers`.
- `jwt` signs callers in with the trusted issuers: each RS256 credential whose `key` is the issuer becomes a trust entry with its public key (only `algorithm`, `key` and `rsa_public_key` are read). The gateway also requires an audience and reads tokens only from the `Authorization` header (stricter). `key_claim_name` other than `iss`, and files with no RS256 issuer credential, are refused `AUTH_SCHEME_UNSUPPORTED`, as are `key-auth`, `basic-auth`, `hmac-auth`, `ldap-auth`, `oauth2` and other sign-in plugins; such a route is never imported as public. A route with `jwt` and no `acl` admits every signed-in caller in Kong; the gateway permits no role there until permits are added (stricter).
- `jwt` with an `anonymous` consumer that callers can reach (no `acl`, or one that admits the anonymous consumer's groups) makes the operation public, as a looser item: it is left out until the item is accepted. Accepting it loses identification there: per-account rate limits count by address and roles do not apply.
- `acl` `allow` becomes the roles permitted (written into the policy only with `--with-permits`), approximated in both directions: Kong decides by the groups stored on the signed-in consumer, the gateway by the token's `roles` claim, so the groups must be issued as roles. `acl` on a route no plugin signs callers in to denies the operation; Kong refuses with 401, the gateway with 403 (approximated). `deny`, `allow_when` and `deny_when` are refused `DENY_LIST_UNSUPPORTED`.
- `rate-limiting` keeps the count and window of `second`, `minute`, `hour` or `day` as a sliding window, `approximated` in both directions with the bounds in the note; with several windows only the shortest is kept (looser, left out until accepted). `month`, `year`, and `limit_by` other than `consumer` (counted by signed-in caller, or by address on public routes) and `ip` are refused `RATE_UNSUPPORTED`. Kong admits requests when its counter store fails (`fault_tolerant`, true by default); the gateway refuses them (stricter).
- `request-size-limiting` becomes the body limit (at most 1 MiB). Kong forwards any body; the gateway accepts only a JSON object on `PUT`, `POST` and `PATCH` (16384 bytes unless limited) and no body on other methods (stricter).
- `cors` becomes the API's browser access when every imported route has the same one (`equivalent`; otherwise none is written and browsers on other origins are refused, which is stricter). Kong reads origins as patterns: an origin with escaped dots (`https://shop\.example\.com`) is exact, a plain one is approximated stricter (Kong's `.` matches any character), and any other pattern is not written. Without `headers` Kong allows any requested header, the gateway none (stricter); `preflight_continue` (Kong forwards preflights) is approximated in both directions. `*` with credentials or on a signed-in route is not written. Kong answers a preflight only on a route that takes `OPTIONS` (elsewhere it answers 404), so where one does not, the browser access is looser and left out until accepted. On export a generated route does not take `OPTIONS`, since Kong would also forward plain `OPTIONS` requests; each is reported `changed`.
- `ip-restriction` `allow` becomes the API's address allow list (`equivalent`; single addresses become `/32` or `/128`); a `status` other than 403 is approximated. One API has one list: a route allowing other addresses is refused `API_SETTING_DIFFERS`, and `deny` is refused `DENY_LIST_UNSUPPORTED`.
- Plugins for one consumer are refused `PER_CONSUMER_UNSUPPORTED`; every other plugin is carried for the way back, not enforced, and also written as Kong's own `x-kong-plugin-<name>` member on each operation it applies to (with `x-kong-route-defaults` at the root), so Kong's OpenAPI tools can read the exchange file. Certificates, upstreams, vaults and the other entities outside the API configuration are listed, never read.
- Credentials are never read or copied: consumer credential lists, certificates and keys are counted in `credentials_skipped`, and plugin options named as credentials (`password`, `secret`, `token` and the like) or holding a private key are removed from carried values and counted as `plugin_secret_fields`. Consumers are not migrated; only their names, groups and RS256 public keys are kept, to work out access on the way back.
- `migrate policy` refuses an exchange file whose operations come from more than one Kong service, because one API has one upstream: import a file with one service.

`export` restores every route whose operations are unchanged since the import exactly as it was read, with its plugins, so an unedited round trip returns the same configuration. A changed route, and an operation from another source, is written as one route per operation with an anchored regular-expression path (`~/a$` exact, `~/a/.+` for `/a/*`), `strip_path: false`, and the plugins its rules need: `jwt`, `acl`, `request-termination` (403) when access is denied or no role is permitted, `rate-limiting` as Kong's calendar window of the same count and length with `fault_tolerant: false`, `request-size-limiting`, `ip-restriction` with the API's allow list, and `cors` with its origins escaped as exact patterns (an empty header list is reported `changed`, since Kong then allows any header). An exchange file from Kong whose browser access or allow list was edited is refused; change the plugin in Kong instead. Request and header schemas, and windows other than 1 s, 1 min, 1 h and 1 day, are listed in `not_carried`. A forward rule's added prefix becomes the service `path`. Kong strips only a matched plain path, which also matches longer paths, so with a strip prefix a changed route is not written and is listed in `not_carried` with the hand-written alternative; an exchange file from Kong whose forward rule was edited is refused. Without `--with-upstream` each service's host is `upstream.invalid`; with `--with-trust` each trusted issuer is written as a consumer with its RS256 public keys; Kong has no blocked-account list. The report lists `restored` and `generated` routes, `changed`, `not_carried`, `manual_steps` and `stale_decisions`; the exit status is `0` only when every route was restored and nothing is left to do.

## How it is built

- The gateway has its own HTTP server and reverse proxy, built on the Go standard library. It serves HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 in plain text. Each request passes all five controls in one pipeline and then goes only to the API that the policy names, once.
- The project implements the policy model and the five controls itself.
- One SQLite controller stores complete policy versions, roles, permits, independent account blocks, administrators and durable change receipts. Protected requests read immutable snapshots rather than querying the database. The gateway refuses protected admission from state it cannot verify.
- Only the project controller changes the policy in use. The data plane has no administration endpoint.
- A protected admin API listens on a local address only. Administrators sign in with a password and hold explicit permissions. The API reads policy and history, stages and checks complete candidates, and activates, confirms or rolls them back. It also manages temporary overrides, independent account blocks and disk-only key reloads. Read-only checks answer whether a role may call an endpoint (with the request pipeline's own matching and permission code, for the policy in force or a draft), report each built-in limit with its current use and how many tokens each trusted key verified, and give fixed-rule advice: risky settings, unused permissions and alerts. Advice never changes anything.
- The Dashboard's header search by Ref and the live events use an in-memory window of the latest 10,000 API outcomes. A security log search reads the active and rotated audit files, newest first and bounded per page, and exports matching requests as CSV or JSON; it names any log file that has been moved away. Event streams have bounded queues, disclose dropped events and stop with the administrator's session. Traffic summaries and a separate loopback Prometheus listener expose bounded operational measurements without token, subject or address labels.
- Local commands set up the first administrator, add or reset administrators, make and restore checked database backups, and upgrade a database made by an earlier version. A restored backup serves nothing until an administrator confirms a new policy that allows nothing, and a provisional policy in the backup never comes back.
- A web dashboard for administrators (in `dashboard/`) is served by the admin listener itself, so it uses the same sign-in, origin and CSRF checks as the admin API. It shows the confirmed policy, any provisional policy and its deadline, the temporary overrides in force and the change history. It stages and activates new policies, confirms or rolls them back and creates or revokes overrides. It also has pages for the security log search, the access checker, limits and advice, and shows active alerts on its overview. Each change is shown as done only when the gateway's receipt arrives, and a request with no answer is shown as having an unknown outcome.
- Fetch, the demonstration application in `client/`, is served on a second loopback address, so the administrator's session cookie never reaches it. Customers, merchants, riders, support agents and operations staff sign in through Fetch Accounts. Application calls go through the gateway to Inventory, Orders, Reports, Support and Accounts. Business ownership, stock, wallet and order transitions stay in those services.

### Code layout

Each package under `internal/` imports only the packages listed before it; a test enforces the order.

- `internal/fault`: the fault-injection points tests use to crash, delay or fail the gateway at exact places. They act only in binaries built with the `faultinject` tag; normal builds compile them to no-ops.
- `internal/policy`: the policy document: its types, strict JSON decoding, and the limits and identifier formats every policy must meet.
- `internal/compile`: turns a policy into an immutable generation (routes, permits, rate rules, body and header schemas) that requests are decided against, readable only through methods; it also owns the trusted clock for deadlines.
- `internal/forward`: sends an admitted request to the one upstream it is bound to, on a new connection each time; a missing or non-loopback binding is sent nowhere.
- `internal/store`: the one SQLite database (policy versions, draft changes, temporary rules, blocked accounts, administrators, change receipts); the only code that runs SQL, holding the database exclusively.
- `internal/audit`: the durable security log; an admitted request is acknowledged only after its record is synced to disk, and the writer never deletes a file.
- `internal/openapi`: the offline OpenAPI import and export; it turns a description into a candidate policy, checks it with the compiler, and writes one API of a policy back as a description.
- `internal/exchange`: the migration exchange file's ledger: its types, strict reading and the rules every ledger must meet.
- `internal/overlay`: decisions files: a restricted Overlay 1.2.0 profile that may only make operations stricter or accept a looser ledger item, applied in order to a copy of an exchange file.
- `internal/semantics`: the meaning of settings other gateways use (path matching and rewriting, identity, roles, rate algorithms, failure modes) and how far each is from the gateway's own, with the bounds of each rate algorithm.
- `internal/convert/kong`: Kong decK files: which settings the gateway can enforce and how closely, read into an exchange file, and written back as a decK file.
- `internal/probe`: boundary probes of an exchange file, the reference evaluator that decides a request from routes reduced to the shared meanings, and the judgement of a difference against its ledger item.
- `internal/migrate`: the offline `gateway migrate` commands, which classify a configuration into an exchange file, turn an exchange file into a candidate policy, another gateway's file or probes, and count what a file holds.
- `internal/gateway`: the gateway itself, which uses the packages above.

## Build and test

You need Go 1.26 or newer. `go.mod` selects the Go 1.27.3 toolchain; with `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`, Go uses or downloads that toolchain when needed. Programs live in `cmd/`, with shared code in `internal/gateway` and `internal/services`. The preserved controlled APIs for gateway regression tests live in `internal/services/testfixture`. The two web applications are in `dashboard/` and `client/`.

- `cmd/gateway` runs the gateway from one strict JSON configuration file. It has the commands `run`, `install`, `enrol`, `backup`, `restore` and `migrate`, each with `--config <file>`, and the offline `policy import-openapi` and `policy export-openapi` (see above). The local commands `install`, `enrol`, `backup`, `restore` and `migrate` run while the gateway is stopped.
- `cmd/services -service inventory|orders|reports|support -secret-file <service.secret>` runs a Fetch business API, with independent authenticated receipts, state and reset. Defaults honor `EAT_PORT_OFFSET`; `-listen` and `-control` select explicit loopback addresses. Orders uses `-inventory <http-origin>` and Reports uses `-orders <http-origin>` for authenticated internal calls.
- `cmd/accounts -secret-file <service.secret> -signing-settings <accounts.json>` runs Fetch Accounts. Signing settings contain `kid` and an absolute `private_key_file`. Only Accounts signs application tokens, which last 15 minutes. Account and signing secrets stay in the private demonstration state.
- `cmd/testfixture` preserves the three earlier controlled APIs for gateway regression tests. The Fetch demonstration does not build or run it.
- `cmd/demo` builds, sets up and runs the full local stack with `up`. `setup` writes `gateway.json`, complete baseline and deny-all policies, `service.secret`, a signing key pair and `accounts.json` into a new identified private directory, then installs the first administrator. `run` starts the five services and gateway, reports protected admission separately from listening, and stops its own children gracefully. `token` is an optional client of Accounts for a seeded subject; it cannot change the fixed 15-minute lifetime. `reset` restores every service's seed and clears its receipts. `events` prints request events from the active audit file; retained rotated files are not searched.
- `cmd/measure -samples 30 -account cust-001` collects preliminary paired wallet latency against an isolated running Fetch stack, directly and through the gateway. It honors `EAT_PORT_OFFSET`, keeps credentials out of output, checks equivalent successful responses, and emits raw observations and aggregate JSON.

```
go build -trimpath -o <out-dir>/gateway.exe ./cmd/gateway
go build -trimpath -o <out-dir>/services.exe ./cmd/services
go build -trimpath -o <out-dir>/accounts.exe ./cmd/accounts
go build -trimpath -o <out-dir>/testfixture.exe ./cmd/testfixture
go build -trimpath -o <out-dir>/demo.exe ./cmd/demo
go build -trimpath -o <out-dir>/measure.exe ./cmd/measure
```

`-trimpath` keeps local build directory names out of the programs. Reproducing an identical binary also requires the same source, toolchain, dependencies, build flags and environment.

Run the required Go checks from the repository root. In PowerShell, give backend verification its isolated port offset:

```powershell
$env:EAT_PORT_OFFSET='1000'
go mod verify
gofmt -l cmd internal
go vet ./...
go vet -tags faultinject ./...
go test ./... -count=1
```

`gofmt -l` must print nothing. The gateway regression tests start real gateway and controlled API processes and check independent request receipts. The Fetch integration test starts all five services and walks the role flows, refusals, policy changes, blocks, keys and resets. Tests use isolated synthetic identities and temporary state: the controlled-test issuer is in memory, while real Accounts tests create private signing files in temporary directories. No application signing key is shipped in source. Race and optional WSL checks have separate evidence; an unrun platform check is not implied by a passing Windows suite. The migration tests send probes to a live gateway and compare it with a model of the source gateway; with `APIWARD_CONTAINERS=kong` they also run Kong Gateway OSS 3.9.4 in Docker (image `kong:3.9.4`, published on loopback only, Admin API off) and compare with Kong itself. Without that variable the container test is skipped.

The dashboard is in `dashboard/` and the website in `client/` (React and TypeScript, built with Vite). Each has its own browser tests, which drive a real demonstration made by `cmd/demo` (see their READMEs). To run the demonstration by hand, put the dashboard build in `<web-dir>/admin` and the website build in `<web-dir>/demo`, then:

```
demo setup -dir <new-dir> -web <web-dir> -gateway <out-dir>/gateway.exe
demo run -dir <new-dir> -gateway <out-dir>/gateway.exe -services <out-dir>/services.exe -accounts <out-dir>/accounts.exe
```

The dashboard is at `http://127.0.0.1:9440/` and the website at `http://127.0.0.2:9480/`. Metrics are at `http://127.0.0.1:9450/metrics` on a separate loopback listener. `EAT_PORT_OFFSET` shifts the demonstration ports; for example, `1000` selects data port 10480, admin port 10440 and metrics port 10450.

### One command

With Go and Node.js installed, run from the repository root:

```
go run ./cmd/demo up
```

Each run builds the gateway, services, Accounts and both websites from the current sources. It prints all fourteen fictional demo accounts; their shared public password is `FetchDemo2026!`. The first run asks you to choose a separate password for the Dashboard administrator `root`, then establishes deny-all genesis and confirms the Fetch baseline through the Admin API. Later runs keep the administrator and policy; service business data starts from its deterministic seed on restart. Programs, builds and state are kept in `EAT40005-demo` in the user cache folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows); `-home <dir>` chooses another folder. `-fresh` replaces identified earlier state and creates a fresh version 4 deployment; it never migrates a version 3 policy. Press Ctrl+C to stop everything. `-stdin` also stops when standard input closes, after any password prompts.

If an earlier native setup stopped before any administrator, candidate or policy existed, `up` recognizes that unfinished state, asks for the initial Dashboard password and preserves the complete earlier directory under `state-before-fetch-<id>` in the same home before creating the Fetch setup at `state/`. This needs no alternate home or reset flag. An earlier deployment with saved authority, mismatched files, a corrupt database or another process holding it is refused before building. Current Fetch deployments continue to reuse their administrator and policy.

At the default offset, Inventory, Orders, Reports, Support and Accounts listen on `127.0.0.1:9501` through `9505`, with protected control listeners on `9601` through `9605`. Orders reserves Inventory stock and Reports reads Orders history through fixed `/internal/` endpoints with `X-Service-Key` from `service.secret`. Those endpoints have no gateway routes. Every service response carries `X-Service`; gateway refusals do not. The controls expose `/state`, `/receipts` and `/reset` with a separate bearer secret. Keep the state directory and all service/control listeners private to the local demonstration.

While the stack is running, these commands use its identified `state` directory:

```
go run ./cmd/demo reset -dir <home>/state
go run ./cmd/demo attack -dir <home>/state -scenario flood-search -from 127.0.0.50 -count 65
go run ./cmd/demo attack -dir <home>/state -scenario flood-login -from 127.0.0.51 -count 12
go run ./cmd/demo attack -dir <home>/state -scenario flood-orders -from 127.0.0.52 -count 12
go run ./cmd/demo keys rotate -dir <home>/state
go run ./cmd/demo keys retire -dir <home>/state -kid <old-key-id>
go run ./cmd/demo policy export -dir <home>/state -out <new-policy-file>
go run ./cmd/demo policy stage -dir <home>/state -file <policy-file>
go run ./cmd/demo events -dir <home>/state -last 20
```

The order flood signs in as Customer 2 (`cust-002`), keeping Customer 1's (`cust-001`) checkout quota separate. It consumes Customer 2's per-account quota, including any checkout requests from its lab tab. It creates real demonstration cash orders until limited; reset the isolated demo afterwards. Different source addresses isolate the public search and login quotas.

Key and policy commands prompt for the `root` Dashboard password and use its session, Origin and CSRF protections. Rotation writes a new pair locally, adds public trust and reloads it before switching Accounts; the old key remains trusted until retirement. The current Accounts key cannot be retired. A failed or unconfirmed reload leaves Accounts signing unchanged and reports the uncertainty. Retirement removes public trust but retains key files for the operator. Policy export writes only to a new file. Policy staging validates a complete candidate against the current confirmed revision and does not activate it. No command automatically repeats a write without an answer.

Flood commands send bounded serial traffic from the chosen IPv4 loopback address and print response counts. Search and login exercise per-address quotas; checkout exercises the signed-in customer's quota and creates real synthetic cash orders until it is limited. Reset afterwards for another demonstration. Money uses integer sen, wallets start at 10000 sen and checkout keys replay the first exact result without repeating the charge or reservation. Business state is in memory; policy, administrators, blocks and change receipts remain in the gateway's single SQLite controller.

The gateway rejects a Caddy JSON configuration file and never converts one by itself. Keep the gateway stopped when running local operator commands; a deployment lock prevents two processes from sharing a database. Successful operator commands exit 0; refusals and failures exit 1. `install` and `enrol` print a one-time secret intentionally: keep that output private. On Windows, file modes do not establish confidentiality. Existing deployment and backup directories need operator-managed DACLs. New demonstration directories receive a protected DACL for the current user, SYSTEM and administrators; this does not isolate them from a privileged host administrator.
